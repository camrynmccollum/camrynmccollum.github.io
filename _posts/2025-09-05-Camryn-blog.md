Hi, my name is Camryn McCollum.  I am a Biology major and will graduate in 2029!
My goal in life is to be successful all around.  I hope to get into Physician Assistant school after I graduate, and I hope to be a Physician Assistant in the future.  
One of my hobbies includes playing volleyball.  I am on the Women's Volleyball team here at the University of Memphis, and it is a lot of fun!  I also enjoy reading and hanging out with friends and family in my free time.   
My favorite subject is Psychology or Chemistry.  I love learning about how the mind works, and I love Chemistry as I think it is fun to do!

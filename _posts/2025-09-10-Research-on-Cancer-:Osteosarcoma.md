Osteosarcoma occurs at a rate of 5.4 per million persons in males and 4 per million in females

Osteosarcoma is usually identified through different imaging tests: CT scans, MRIs, and X-rays.  

There are a few risk factors that may give a person a high risk of getting osteosarcoma.  One is that some children could have gene changes in their body.  The gene changes could be developed early on before a child is born or inherited by a parent, which increases their risk for getting the cancer.  Another risk factor is that people treated with radiation therapy for another cancer tend to have a higher risk of developing osteosarcoma.  

There are a couple staging systems used for osteosarcoma.  One system is the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) staging system.  This system is based on the grade of the tumor, extent of the primary tumor, and if the tumor has been mestastasized.  These factors combined help to give an overall stage of the cancer.  Low grade, localized cancers are stage I.  High grade, localized cancers are stage II.  Metastatic tumors are stage III.  Another staging system is the TMN staging system.  This system is based on the size of the main tumor, tbe extent of spread to nearby lymph nodes, if the cancer has spread to nearby organs, and the grade of the tumor.  This information is then combined to help develop the stage of the cancer.  These stages are described using Roman numerals I through IV.  

Treating osteosarcoma usually includes surgery and chemotherapy.  The surgery can be done to remove the cancer only (limb sparing cancer), remove the affected arm or leg (amputation), or to remove the lower portion of the leg (rotationplasty).  The chemotherapy is used to treat with strong medicines.  Chemotherapy is usually done before surgery to help make the cancer easier to remove by shrinking the size of it.  Chemotherapy is also used after surgery to help kill any cancer cells that may remain.  In general, the chemotherapy helps relieve pain and slow the growth of cancer.  

Overall, about 60-70% of people diagnosed with osteosarcoma will be cured.  Survival rates usually depend on whether the cancer is localized, metastatic, or if it's relapsed.  If it is localized, the survival rates range from 60-75%.  If it is metastatic, the survival rates range from 5-30%.  If it is relapsed, the outlook depends on the location and timing of the relapse.  The outlook is better when the recurrent tumors can be removed with surgery.

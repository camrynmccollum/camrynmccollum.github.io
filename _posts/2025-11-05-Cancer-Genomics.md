Genomic sequencing lets scientists read the DNA inside tumor cells and compare it to normal cells. This helps them see which changes, called mutations, actually cause cancer and which ones just happen by chance. One common kind of change is a SNP, or single nucleotide polymorphism, which is basically when one letter in the DNA code is switched. Some SNPs don’t do anything, but others can affect how genes work and sometimes lead to cancer.
I learned that most tumors have thousands of mutations, but only a few are the real “drivers” that make the cancer grow. The rest are just “passengers.” An oncogene is a normal gene that becomes harmful when it mutates, kind of like a gas pedal stuck down.
A 2013 study by Bert Vogelstein found that even though tumors can have tons of mutations, most cancers only have two to eight that really matter. Another paper showed that these changes can happen in many different types of genes, not just the ones scientists expected.
What I found most interesting is how this research helps doctors find treatments based on the exact mutations in someone’s tumor. It’s amazing that by reading DNA, scientists can figure out what’s driving a person’s cancer and how to fight it.

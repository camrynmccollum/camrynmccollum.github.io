Are you defined by your genome?

I don’t think people are fully defined by their genome. Yes, they can definitely shape and play a role in how we look, some of our certain behaviors, and some parts of our health, but they don't fully determine everything. I think of the genome like a blueprint. It gives a plan, but the final outcome depends on the environment, experiences, and one's personal choices.

There are some rare cases where one gene can almost entirely determine an outcome, like with Huntington’s disease (Collins et al., 2003). But for most traits, it’s more complicated. Research shows that even the best genetic predictions for things like educational attainment only explain about 10–16% of the differences between people (Okbay et al., 2016). That means a lot of who we become comes from outside influences.

Twin studies make this clear too. Even identical twins, who share the same DNA, can grow up with different personalities or health outcomes depending on their life experiences. Plus, environmental factors can actually affect how genes work through something called epigenetics.

Overall, genes are an important part of who we are, but they don’t define us on their own. Our environment, experiences, and decisions play a huge role too.

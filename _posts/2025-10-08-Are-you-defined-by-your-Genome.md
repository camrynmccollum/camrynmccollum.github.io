Are you defined by your genome?

I don’t think people are fully defined by their genome. I think that genomes can play a part in how people look, some of the behaviors they give off, and even determine the trajectory of their health, but one's genome does not fully determine who they are as a person.  There is some much more to a person than just their genome.  I think of the genome as a plan, but how that plan is carried out depends on one's environment and personal experiences.  

There are some rare cases where one gene can almost entirely determine an outcome, like with Huntington’s disease (Collins et al., 2003). But for most traits, it’s more complicated. Research shows that even the best genetic predictions for things like educational attainment only explain about 10–16% of the differences between people (Okbay et al., 2016). That means a lot of who we become comes from outside influences.

Twins also make this point clear.  Twins can grow up with different health outcomes and personalities, even though they share the same DNA.  To add on, environmental factors can affect how genes work through something called epigenetics.

Overall, genes are an important part of who we are, but they don’t define us on their own. Our environment, experiences, and decisions play a huge role too.

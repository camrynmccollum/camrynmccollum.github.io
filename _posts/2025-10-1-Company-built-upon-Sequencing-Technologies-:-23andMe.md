23andMe is a company that changed the way people learn about their genes. It started out helping people find out their ancestry and health risks through a simple saliva test. But over the years, the company has faced big challenges, including financial problems and privacy concerns.

Founder:

23andMe was founded in 2006 by Anne Wojcicki, along with Linda Avey and Paul Cusenza. Anne, who used to work in healthcare investing, wanted to make genetic information available to everyone. The company got its first big investment in 2007—$3.9 million from Google, where Anne’s then-husband, Sergey Brin, was a co-founder.

Main Business Focus: 

23andMe started by offering genetic tests that tell people about their ancestry and potential health risks. They used a technology called SNP genotyping, which makes testing affordable and simple for regular consumers. Later, the company also started working with big drug companies, like GlaxoSmithKline, to use its genetic data to help develop new medicines.

Money and Growth: 

Over time, 23andMe raised a lot of money—almost $944 million in total. At its highest point in 2021, the company was worth about $6 billion. But things didn’t go smoothly. By 2024, the company’s value had dropped to just a tiny fraction of that. On top of that, in 2025, a big data breach affected almost 7 million users, and the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Future of the Company:

Right now, the future of 23andMe is uncertain. In 2025, a nonprofit led by Anne Wojcicki bought the company’s assets for $305 million. There are questions about what direction the company will take and how it will protect users’ private genetic information. The California Attorney General even warned users to delete their data because of privacy concerns.
